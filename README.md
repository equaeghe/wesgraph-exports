# WESgraph database exports

This repository contains exports from the WESgraph (Wind Energy System graph) database.
This is a graph database for the wind farm domain.
It can be accessed at https://wesgraph.lr.tudelft.nl/; contact the authors for login credentials, if you wish to access this database.

The purpose of this export is to make the contents of the database available in a way that does not require access to the database.
Requests for editorial changes to the database content are welcome (as issues).

Currently, the only export provided is in the form of a JSON dump in a self-explanatory format where the nodes of the graph are listed at the front of the file and the edges at the end.
